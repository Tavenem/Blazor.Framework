<PageTitle>Form - Tavenem Blazor Framework</PageTitle>

<h1>Form</h1>

<p>
    Tavenem Blazor Framework form components support three methods of form validation and submission.
</p>

<p>
    They can also be used without any containing form element at all. Even <a
    href="./components/validation">validation</a> can be used on a Tavenem Blazor Framework form
    component without a containing form.
</p>

<h2>The Form component</h2>

<p>
    The Tavenem Blazor Framework includes a <code>Form</code> component which wraps a native
    <code>form</code> element, and also inherits from the built-in Blazor <code>EditForm</code>
    component, in addition to powerful validation and data handling features of its own.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike the built-in <code>EditForm</code> component, the Tavenem Blazor Framework
    <code>Form</code> component does not require a <code>Model</code> or an
    <code>EditContext</code>. Although it supports either, they are optional. When neither is
    provided, a default <code>EditContext</code> is supplied to descendant form components.
</p>

<p>
    For details on the validation capabilities of a <code>Form</code> component, see <a
    href="./components/validation">validation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Forms provide a <code>FieldChanged</code> event callback which is raised whenever a contained
    form component is modified. This works for both Tavenem Blazor Framework form components,
    and also built-in Blazor form components.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
    The <code>IsModified</code> method determines whether any fields within the form have been
    modified from their initial state. This works for both Tavenem Blazor Framework form components,
    and also built-in Blazor form components. Modification of third-party input components
    <em>may</em> be detected, if those components are designed to interact as expected with a
    containing <code>EditContext</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>MarkAsUnmodified</code> method will reset the <code>IsTouched</code> property of all
    Tavenem Blazor Framework form components within the form to <code>false</code>, which affects
    how the <code>Required</code> property is treated during validation.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>ResetAsync</code> method will reset all Tavenem Blazor Framework form components
    within the form to their initial states. This also resets the fields' <code>IsTouched</code>
    value to <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Note that the <code>MarkAsUnmodified</code> and <code>ResetAsync</code> methods have no effect
    on controls which do not implemnent the Tavenem Blazor Framework <code>IFormComponent</code>
    interface, such as the native Blazor input components, or components from other libraries.
</p>

<h2>Blazor EditForm support</h2>

<p>
    Tavenem Blazor Framework form components are designed to integrate fully with Blazor's built-in
    <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-validation"><code>EditForm</code>
    component</a>. If you are already using <code>EditForm</code>s for validation and form
    submission, you can start using Tavenem Blazor Framework form components alongside the built-in
    Blazor form components, or as replacements for the built-in components.
</p>

<h2>Native HTML forms</h2>

<p>
    The simplest way to use Tavenem Blazor Framework form components is to include them in a native
    HTML <code>form</code> element, with a <code>button</code> that has its <code>type</code>
    attribute set to <code>submit</code>. All Tavenem Blazor Framework form components contain
    native <code>input</code> elements at their core, with appropriate input types, and values in
    the format expected for the input type, to facilitate basic data parsing and binding.
</p>

<p>
    Set the <code>Name</code> property on your input components to ensure that their values
    will be included in form submission events.
</p>

<p>
    Note that submitting a native form usually causes a page redirect or refresh, which is not
    usually desirable for single page applications such as Blazor.
