<h1>Contents</h1>

<p>
    The contents component displays a list of headings on the current page, with
    links to each of them.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
    Use the <code>Contents</code> component to create a table of contents for the component's
    container. The list is built automatically by examining the container for heading elements, as
    well as any element with the <code>tav-heading</code> class. Elements with the
    <code>tav-heading</code> class can specify their effective level with the
    <code>data-heading-level</code> attribute, which should be a value between 1 and 6.
</p>

<p>
    The contents list is rebuilt on page navigation, but does not respond to dynamic adding or
    removing of headings. If heading elements might be dynamically added or removed on a page, you
    can call the <code>RefreshHeadingsAsync</code> method on the <code>Contents</code> component to
    refresh the list. Note, however, that this will also remove any headings manually added with the
    <code>AddHeading</code> method (see below).
</p>

<p>
    Each item in the contents list will display the text content of the heading element, but you can
    override this by assigning a value to the <code>data-heading-title</code> attribute.
</p>

<p>
    Note that if a heading has no HTML <code>id</code>, clicking its listing in the contents will
    scroll to the nearest heading with its title. If two headings in scope both have the same title,
    this may cause undesired behavior. In that case it is recommended that each heading be given a
    unique <code>id</code>.
</p>

<p>
    You can make a <code>Contents</code> component responsive by setting the <code>Breakpoint</code>
    parameter to the breakpoint at which the list should be visible. When set to <code>None</code>
    (the default) the list is visible at all breakpoints.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>ThemeColor</code> parameter can be set to control the color theme
    of the list.
</p>

<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>
    The <code>FrameworkLayout</code> component has a built-in <code>Contents</code> component. It is
    positioned after the main content (typically on the right-hand side of a page), and will
    automatically share the <code>ThemeColor</code> of the parent <code>FrameworkLayout</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>Breakpoint</code> parameter of the built-in <code>Contents</code> component can be set
    with the <code>ContentsBreakpoint</code> parameter of <code>FrameworkLayout</code> (it defaults
    to <code>Lg</code>). There is one key difference, however: when set to <code>None</code> the
    table of contents is hidden completely, rather than displayed at all breakpoints. This allows
    you to suppress the built-in list (possibly in order to use it differently in your own layout).
</p>

<h2>Manual Headings</h2>

<p>
    It is also possible to add headings to the table(s) of contents on a page manually. The
    <code>Contents</code> component has two key methods for this purpose: <code>AddHeading</code>
    and <code>RemoveHeading</code>, both of which take a <code>HeadingInfo</code> object that
    describes a heading. The <code>FrameworkLayout</code> also provides these same methods, in order
    to add or remove headings from the built-in contents, and provides itself as a <a
    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/cascading-values-and-parameters">cascading
    value</a> so you can accesss these methods from any component.
</p>

<p>
    Adding a heading will automatically add it to the <code>Contents</code> component. It is
    important that you also remove the heading when it is no longer relevant. For instance, in the
    <code>Dispose</code> method of a component which adds it.
</p>

<p>
    You can try this yourself by clicking the following buttons, which will add or remove the
    heading below to this page's table of contents:
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Heading</h3>
<div class="d-flex gap-3">
    <button class="btn primary" @onclick="AddHeading" disabled="@_added">Add Heading to Contents</button>
    <button class="btn danger" @onclick="RemoveHeading" disabled="@(!_added)">Remove Heading from Contents</button>
</div>
