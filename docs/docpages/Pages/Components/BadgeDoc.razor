<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H1">Badge</Heading>

<p>
    The badge component is small notification display element which overlaps a corner of another
    element.
</p>

<p>
    To create a badge, add the <code>badge</code> class to a <code>span</code> (or other semantic
    element).
</p>

<p>
    The parent element (which is decorated with the badge) must have its <code>position</code>
    property set to <code>relative</code>. To add content, you must wrap the content with an element
    (such as a <code>span</code>). Text placed directly inside the <code>badge</code> element will
    not display properly.
</p>

<CodeExample RowClass="p-2" Code="@(@"<span class=""position-relative""><span>Updates</span><span class=""badge warning""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><tf-icon>mail</tf-icon><span class=""badge""><span>3</span></span></span>")" />

<p>
    To make the badge overlap its associated element, add the <code>overlap</code> class.
</p>

<CodeExample IsOpen="false" Code="@(@"<span class=""position-relative""><span>Updates</span><span class=""badge overlap info""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><tf-icon>mail</tf-icon><span class=""badge overlap primary""><span>99+</span></span></span>")" />

<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H1">Position</Heading>

<p>
    The position of the badge relative to its associated element can be adjusted with a set of positioning classes.
</p>

<CodeExample Code="@(@"<span class=""position-relative""><span>Top-right</span><span class=""badge primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Center-right</span><span class=""badge center-right primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Bottom-right</span><span class=""badge bottom primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Bottom-center</span><span class=""badge bottom-center primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Bottom-left</span><span class=""badge bottom-left primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Center-left</span><span class=""badge center-left primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Top-left</span><span class=""badge left primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Top-center</span><span class=""badge center primary""></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Center</span><span class=""badge center-center primary""></span></span>")" />

<p>
    Note that badges are absolutely positioned, which means that they may overlap with surrounding
    elements, or cross the boundaries of their parent container. It is up to you either to accept
    these possibilities, or design your layout to prevent such overlap.
</p>

<p>
    Badges and their content are given a z-index of 1 to ensure that the badge is displayed above
    most normal content, but below special components like tooltips and dialogs.
</p>

<Heading Level="HeadingLevel.H1">Variants</Heading>

<p>
    Badges can also be <code>outlined</code> or be given a <code>border</code>:
</p>

<CodeExample RowClass="p-3 gap-5" Code="@(@"<span class=""position-relative""><span>Example</span><span class=""badge primary outlined""><tf-icon>star</tf-icon></span></span>
<span class=""position-relative""><span>Example</span><span class=""badge info border""><span>Note</span></span></span>")" />
