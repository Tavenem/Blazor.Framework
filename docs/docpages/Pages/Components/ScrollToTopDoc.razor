<p>
    The scroll to top component does just what the name implies: clicking on it smoothly scrolls the
    document to the top of the page (or another element). It is hidden by default until the user
    scrolls past a certain point, and the <code>FrameworkLayout</code> element includes a built-in
    version, so you don't need to do anything at all to include one in your Tavenem Blazor Framework
    app, unless you'd like to customize its behavior or appearance.

<p>
    The <code>ScrollToTop</code> component included in the layout by default uses an icon button
    filled with the primary theme color, and has a simple upward caret as its content. If you define
    your own componment, you can include any <code>ChildContent</code> within it that you like. The
    component itself has no specific appearance, allowing complete customization.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>Selector</code> property can be set to a CSS selector, which will be used to find the
    element to which the scroll event will be attached. If left <code>null</code> the main document
    will be the target. To add a <code>ScrollToTop</code> to a subsection of a document, simply give
    that section an id and use that id (preceded by a '#' character) as the <code>Selector</code>. A
    <code>ScrollToTop</code> with a non-<code>null Selector</code> does not replace the default
    <code>ScrollToTop</code> that targets the full page.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>TopOffset</code> property indicates the distance in pixels from the top of the
    selected element at which the component becomes visible. The default is 300. To make the
    component visible at all times, you should set this to zero and also set the
    <code>Visible</code> property to <code>true</code>.
