<h1>Heading</h1>

<p>
    The heading component is a way of displaying one of the heading elements (<code>h1</code>,
    <code>h2</code>, etc.). It has limited use on its own (possibly when the level of the heading
    must be determined dynamically). Its intended purpose is to support auto-generated tables of
    contents. See the <a href="./components/contents">Contents</a> component documentation for
    details.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
    Use the <code>Level</code> property to set the type of heading element.
    <code>HeadingLevel.H1</code> corresponds to an <code>h1</code> element, and so on.
    <code>HeadingLevel.None</code> will generate a <code>span</code>, and can be used when you want
    to include inline text or some other element in a table of contents, without the styling or
    semantic meaning associated with a heading element.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>Title</code> property sets the text shown in the table of contents. If unset, the text
    content of the element will be used. This property is helpful when your heading might use
    styling or extra text that is inappropriate for the table of contents (e.g. bold, underline,
    numbering, etc.).
</p>

<p>
    The <code>ThemeColor</code> property can be used to assign a theme color to the heading. This
    color will not be reflected in the table of contents, only in the heading itself.
